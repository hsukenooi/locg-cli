# locg

Command-line interface for [League of Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com). Browse releases, search series, manage your collection, pull list, wish list, and read list.

All output is JSON, making it easy to pipe into `jq` or other tools.

## Installation

pip install .
# or
pipx install .
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

## Authentication
